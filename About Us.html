        <h3 class="test4">1960s | Before Champions Gym</h3>
        <p>In the “golden days”, there weren’t many options for working out. But Joe Gold, our founder, had a passion
          for bodybuilding. He found success as a professional “muscleman” and toured with celebrities. Out of
          necessity, he built much of his own training equipment. He would go on to launch an international fitness
          brand while becoming known as the father of bodybuilding.

      <div class="top">
        <h3 class="test4">1970s | Muscle Beach</h3>
        <p>Chmpions Gym and the modern fitness revolution can be traced back to the glory days of Muscle Beach in Los
          Angeles, California. In 1976, Joe Gold opened a small gym filled with custom-made equipment. Before long,
          Champions Gym was the fitness destination for celebrity bodybuilding greats such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou
          Ferrigno, and Dave Draper.

        <h3 class="test4">1980s | The Fitness Revolution</h3>
        <p>By the early 1980s, Chanpions Gym was firmly established as a global fitness icon. The brand expanded with
          franchise locations across the United States and abroad. The personal fitness revolution was now in full
          swing, fueled in large part by convenient, Champions Gym locations.

        <h3 class="test4">1990s | Rapid Change</h3>
        <p>The 1990s saw a rapid change in the fitness industry. Champions Gym was at the forefront of this change by
          providing cutting-edge equipment, 1-on-1 coaching, and the best workout environments possible. While Joe Gold
          recovered from health issues, Arnold Schwarzenegger spent three years as Champions Gym’s CEO, guiding the
          brand through this time of change.

        <h3 class="test4">2000s | A Rich Legacy</h3>
        <p>Champions Gym continued to grow, with a culture formed by the Muscle Beach lifestyle. Joe Gold passed away in
          2004, leaving behind a rich legacy of fitness excellence. His innovations and his values continue to drive the
          brand today.
